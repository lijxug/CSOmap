We provide both matlab version and R version, please refer to the corresponding README.md

We highly recommend using the matlab version if possible. It is the version that we used in our paper "Reconstruction of cell spatial organization from single-cell RNA sequencing data based on ligand-receptor mediated self-assembly".

The R version includes the main algorithm, but it does not provide figures or statistical tests.

We compressed the demo dataset via gzip, please decompress the .gz files before running any scripts.
